# Sovereign Subjects
This site is a kind of scratchpad for linking fieldwork and ongoing research projects with my university teaching. It has three primary dimensions:

1. A broad application of indigenous politics around concept of visual sovereignty and contemporary political events.

2. The application of visual and open-source tools to everyday forms of empowerment.

3. Snippets/class examples for student projects.
