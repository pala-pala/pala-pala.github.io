                                My <em>Introduction to Political Thought</em> course is increasingly tied to the visual, the aural, and the social. In this sense, we read Pablo Helguera's <a href="http://pablohelguera.net/2011/11/education-for-socially-engaged-art-2011/" class="navo"><em>Education for Socially Engaged Art</em></a> in place of related political texts, such as Jacques Rancière's <a href="https://abahlali.org/files/Ranciere.pdf" class="navo"> <em>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</em></a>, to consider possible forms of social engagement that overturn some of the hierarchies advanced in Plato early in the semester. For this class, they sent me around the city in search of images to continue recorded conversations they start in the classroom. It's kind of like a "dialogue," with the reimagination of participation that Helguera addresses as conversation. In any case, I like the book as a starting point for thinking through many group projects my students have organized over the years, but also that the entire spectrum of socially-engaged art literature is translated into <a href="https://www.filmart.co.jp/books/978-4-8459-1450-0/" class="navo">Japanese</a>.

                                Filming for <em>Sovereign</em> continues as we seek to frame sovereignty in the context of a kind of subterreanean temporality layered within the present. At Mokuʻula, the site where tradition was enshrined along the constitutional cusp of a new modernity, we listen to the ground amid the ruins of a large baseball field. This revered corridor of time persists even amid Pioneer MIllʻs struggle to eliminate signs of the past.
