	Knowledge builds power in the rethinking of how language (or discourse) works to encapsulate, even compose, subjects. The observation ranges from <text style="color:#208F99;">Michel Foucault's</text> use of the term genealogy to <text style="color:#208F99;">Julia Kristeva</text> and <text style="color:#208F99;">Roland Barthes'</text> emphasis on breaking the conventions of language by re-reading the world of voices (see <em>geno-text'/'geno-song'</em>). A subject is a body and a thematic composition rooted in the language of the past (the archive) and the discontinuous organization of voices. 

Marie Alohalani Brown, masterfully recovers voices of the past in the cataloguing of kanaka maoli narratives of Moʻo Akua--reptile water deities that pointed to larger moʻolelo (narrative historical structures) that fold the kanaka maoli pasts into the present. Her analysis draws heavily on native epistemological structures of organization known as <i>helu</i>:<br><br>

  <blockquote class="blockquote fs-6 lh-base ms-4">

"<span class="highlighter">Reclaiming ancestral knowledge</span> includes recovering knowledge that was once common but that, for whatever reason, became obscure and drawing attention to the ways that knowledge was preserved and the methods by which it was disseminated. This perspective guides my approach to organizing this book. Each chapter begins with a general statement about its main topic and its subtopics, for which I give examples. While this is standard practice, my approach is informed by helu (listing and enumeration), which is crucial to this reclamation project. Helu entails an introduction followed by a list of categories and examples...<span class="highlighter">Our intellectuals used and continue to use helu as a principle to guide their treatises on nā mea Hawaiʻi</span>, whether they discuss deities, aliʻi, ranking, or types of flora and fauna."<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> 
    </blockquote>


Brown goes on to write of the ways <text style="color=#FE8AB6;">"helu"</text> seemed foreign to Western intepretations of 19th century Hawaiʻi and how these meticulous modes of classification help to organize similiarities and differences as connective nodes that exist across the Hawaiian language: for instance, where Moʻo, Moʻolelo, and Moʻopuna align. This point has been addressed in the past by public intellectuals like Akoni Akana and point to the increasing complexity of the digital archive as a tool of empowerment. This epistemological theme also underlies the more general nexus between academic scholarship and the political movement to reclaim land and water in Hawaiʻi.<br>
