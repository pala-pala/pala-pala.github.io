<p><span class="highlighter">Zakariya Amataya</span> won the Southeast Asia Writers Award (or, SEAWrite) in 2010 for the trilingual poetry collection<span class="highlighter"> <i> No Woman in Poetry</i> (2010)</span> and went to Hawaii as an artist-in-residence at the Doris Duke Shangri La Museum of Art, Culture and Design. In Hawai ªi, I started to document his journey and the  mutual love for the sea that inspired his second collection,<span class="highlighter"> <i>If as Deep as the Ocean Within Us</i> (2013)</span>. When he finally returned to his hometown of Narathiwat, after living in Thailand's capital city for over two decades, I followed him with my camera around this fascinating borderland landscape. He is currently at work on his third poetry collection and manages a literary and intellectual  yearbook from the region called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MelayuReview/"><span class="highlighter">The Melayu Review</span></a>. Che also partners with community organizations to organize writing workshops and grassroots media channels to help rebuild a space that has, since the imposition of martial law in 2004, experienced significant restrictions on political speech.</span></p>
