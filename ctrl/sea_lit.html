            "What interests me are the ways this open-endedness and negativity produce a space for the emergence of an <b> authorial voice</b> addressing an absent audience. In between the twisting and twining of these plots, Rizal constructs a series of scenes around particular characters. Many of these have only the most tenuous connections to the narratives. Instead, they bear out another kind of <b>emplotment</b>. In these scenes, Rizal obsessively details the recurrence and effects of the foreign detached from its origins in hierarchy. What emerges in these foreign encounters is a certain <b>politics</b>, colored by anticipation, shame, and resentment, that envisions a response through translation...the failure of recognition and the deferral of the return are built into such a <b>politics</b>, one whose translation requires a voice whose appearance seems new. Such would be the voice of the <b>author</b>."<br><br>

        <p>We might consider literature as one of many possible modes of expression, like film, to express politics and society. First, consider the "foreign" elements that Rafael associates with the novels of "first Filipino" Jose Rizal:<br><br>

            <table>
                <tr style="background-color:pink">
                    <td><b>Foreignness</b></td>
                    <td><b>Translated</b></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>The foreign text</td>
                    <td><em>Noli Me TÃ¡ngere (1887), El Filibusterismo (1891) </em></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>The strange/mythical "nationalist"</td>
                    <td>monuments, "monumentalization," "figure of translation" (p. 38)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"Rizal was the nation we are today."</td>

In other words, the complexities of historical events undergo a <color style="background-color: #F5A2B5">re-translation</color> in the context of a new contemporary "text." As text, the nation-state circulates in possible worlds of the literary.

"I've got to begin in Bangkok." Srimin began to take hold of himself. "I've got to start here: on the deck of the Baiyoke Tower in the center of the Bangkok Metropolis." In this manner he gazed from where he sat, a continuation of a routine begun 3 months ago. The sun spread forth its rays, emanating out through the clouds painting the clusters of distant buildings, turning them pale grey with increasingly darkened shades until it reached the deck where he sat; or, to be more specific, one should note, until the sun struck the old chair where he sat. His gaze penetrated the gloom dimness in front of the spot where the sun rose, trying not to blink. The aged Srimin knew that it was the same sun that each previous day spawned.<br><br>
But it never rose in the same position.

        <h1>Discussion Questions</h1>
        <h7>1. Based on our examples, consider how a novel or short story can illuminate the politics and society of Southeast Asia? How might <b>politics</b> be expressed in such literary contexts?</h7> <br><br>

        <h7>2. In the next few classes, we'll look at several literary examples, such as poetry and censored books. In your opinion, do fiction writes have a responsibility to address politics when they live under authoritarian regimes? Would you? What kinds of challenges might you face? </h7>
