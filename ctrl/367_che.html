        <h1>1. The Politics of Poetry</h1>

        <p>Since 2010, I’ve been working on a project about the poetry of Zakariya Amataya (AKA, Che) and the impact of poetry on rebellion. Later, in 2015, I referred to  it <color style="background-color:
#E3E4F2"><em>After the Bodies Are Counted</em> </color> (after a line from Che’s poem, “Home”) because poetry connects many spaces in-motion, such as cemeteries and checkpoints, and resonates like reveries on life and death. A documentary film about the region might be called  <em>Voices</em> or <em>Rebel</em> because fiction writers gravitate between the representation of a community and the rooms they spend so many hours working, talking to themselves, and listening to music: in other words, between solidarity (มิตรภาพ) and the solitary (ความสันโดษ). In one scene, Che wears a shirt with a quote from Albert Camus’ 1952 essay, <em>The Rebel</em> that reads, <b>“A rebel is a man who says no</b>.”

            <h1>2. Poetry as rebellion</h1>

                <p>Let's take a look at Che's most popular collection, <em>No Women in Poetry</em>. The title itself seems to invite a reflection on the tropes of gender and sexuality in coded language. I read this as Che's rethinking of orientalism in the regional legacies of what Benedict Anderson calls the <b>imagined community</b>. This is why the Thai word "khwam khit" (<em>lit.</em>, 'thought') is translated here as "imagination," which I've highlighted below.  It's worth reprinting the text here (which appears in the middle of the collection). </div>

                            <b>No Women in the Poem</b><br>
A woman in the poem
He created her
From a <color style="background-color:#FF96B6">Strange imagination</color>
A dream of an ancient Red Indian
With letters inscribed on the wall of prehistoric cave:
The origin of a woman in the poem
He typed the characters one by one
Poetry poured forth from the vision in his mind
Her gorgeous eyes gleamed,
Perceiving the world in its entirely
Her hair hung down to the waist
Like waves flowing in the ocean

In truth,
He intended to write:
A Poem in a Woman
But by the slip of his fingers he typed:
A Woman in a Poem
Two divergent phrases
With the same collection of words
He experimented by switching the five words around
His <color style="background-color:#FF96B6">imagination</color> searching for a solution
In which he truly believed
In a Woman a Poem
In a Poem a Woman
He preferred the first two phrases

He continued hammering at the keyboard,
A woman in the <color style="background-color:#FF96B6">imagination</color>
the <color style="background-color: #FF96B6">imagination</color> in a woman
The poem had not ended
Yet he had seen the woman!

                        </pre>

                        <p>The act of writing is, especially in the mediated climate depicted throughout the collection, tied up in many forms of visual consumption. But in Southeast Asia, as Anderson states in Ch. 10 of <em>Imagined Communities</em>, the structure of seeing is historically-conditioned. A poem gives birth to imagination, which reproduces "woman" in a never-ending cycle of reproduction in the body of language. From language, identity, martial law, difference, and poetry itself, is expressed. <br><br>

                            <h1>3. Some Questions</h1>

My favorite poem by Zakariya Amataya changes periodically, possibly because poems undergo fluid journeys that enter and exit our own trajectories. But "Forgotten One" is my current favorite.<br><br>

<pre>
<b>Forgotten One</b>

Amid gems I am a stone
Amid grains of sand I am dust
Amid sons and daughters I am dead in childhood
Amid warriors I am a coward fleeing battle

Amid answers I am a question
Amid lovers I am a flame of envy
Amid sages I am a fool
Amid poets I am a muted
Amid plants I am a weed
Amid flowers I am a grass flower
Amid the galaxy I am a falling star
<color style="background-color:#FF96B6">Amid tyrants I am a rebel</color>

Amid the shores I am a rocky reef
Amid the oceans I am a shallow puddle
Amid beauty I am ugliness
Amid saints I am a sinner

Amid songs I am a requiem
Amid truth I am deceit
Amid racket I am silence
Amid the calendar pages I am a day yet to arrive

Amid the arts I am a pile of trash
Amid civilization I am savagery
Amid praise I am scorn
Amid history I am the forgotten one
