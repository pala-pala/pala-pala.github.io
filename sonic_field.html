    <h2>I have been working on this book for a longtime, almost 20 years if I include the dissertation period. This is what it is about.<br><br>

	First, it is about writing. You do not need a book or series of articles to validate your research. You can be a good listener, an instrument in opening new channels for others to speak. But I love writing and I hope this can be shared to reinforce and cite works that produce interesting feedback when you connect them. In this sense, my writing is about the <text style="color:#114C52;">field</text> where reading and thinking takes place--a field of theories and images that include people like Ariella Aïsha Azoulay who asks <span class="highlighter">"What---is political imagination, and is it solely contingent on action in the realm of the political?."</span> <br><br>
	
  <blockquote class="blockquote fs-6 lh-base ms-4">

"<span class="highlighter"> "The book suggests that the civil must be seperated from the political and defined in its own right as the interest that citizens display in themselves, in others, in their shared forms of coexistence, as well, as in the world that they create and nurture." </span><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> 
    </blockquote>
For her, the imagination is like a paralell state (to "the" State) where numerous forms of shared coexistence produce collaboration in civil partnership. From this, I imagine the word <text style="color:#114C52;">empathy</text>. I donʻt know if ethics or morality can be used as a foundational term as much as some other form of empathic vision. Photographs and the images she describes as a civil imagination inspire me to consider the ways films and other visual mediums might produce an empathic world. <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
