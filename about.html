<h4>
<b>"Palapala"</b>, the Hawaiian word for "the written document," guides my current thinking about how experiences, places, times, etc., are documented. In the history of Hawaiʻi, documentation mutates across maps (Palapalaʻāina), songs (mele), protests petitions and traditional narratives (moʻolelo). The <b>palapala</b> becomes different things for different people, but in them we see <span class="highlighter">waves, movement, and intensities</span>: from one part to another, from darkness to light, and from noise to the beautiful harmonics that emanate from some dissonance beyond the stave. I've come to recognize the intensity of documents as a political phenomenon, especially through the work of teachers like Noenoe Silva and Keʻeaumoku Kapu, but also as collaborations with friends back home in <b>Hawaiʻi</b>. Making documents thus became a political act, from recording a tractor harvesting the roots of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/884284785/20b0db6c8d?share=copy" class="navo" target="_blank">Bellflower</a> in <b>Misato, Akita</b> or in the amplification of voices and microphone feedback in among <a href="https://vimeo.com/872204879/5566fa7363?share=copy" class="navo" target="_blank">poets performing</a> under the restrictions of martial law in the <b>Thai-Malay borderlands</b>. For me, the goal is to allow documentation to illuminate an opening, as a space freedom to think through Pō and Ao an the ever-transformative archipelago.
